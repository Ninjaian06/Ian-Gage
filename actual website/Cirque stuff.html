            <h1 ><strong>Cirque stuff</strong></h1> 
               <p>I have been a fan of Cirque for almost a year and a half. <br>
               I was introduced to it's music through last years marching band show called "La Nouba" 
               based off of the show of the same title, and after researching the marching band compositions, I was hooked. </p>
                <h3 class ="centered_pictures"> Here is a list of my favorite cirque du soliel shows</h3>
                <ol class="bignumber">
                    <div class="centered_pictures"><li class="listtext"><strong>Quidam</strong><br> 
                        <a href="quidam.html"><img src = "/Users/gageian/Downloads/51DpeTHAeVL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" height = "400"></a> <br>
                        This is my favorite show because of the music, which is an amazming mix of jazz and hard rock. Its story is more darker and has a grounded storyline, which immerses you into the story's world.
                    </li> </div>
                    <div class="centered_pictures"><li class="listtext"><strong>Varekai</strong><br>
                        <img src = "/Users/gageian/Downloads/51IjCFLMVOL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" height = "400"> <br>
                        I'm a fan of this show because its music is unique with having the ability to tell a convincing narritive through music. I also really enjoy the the set design of a lot of characters, because they all stand out and are truely unique to this show.
                    </li></div>
                    <div class="centered_pictures"><li class="listtext"><strong>La Nouba</strong><br>

                        This is the show that started my love for cirque, and it still holds up to this day, with its amazing jazz and blues styled music.
